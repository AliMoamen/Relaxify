## API Integration

Relaxify integrates with the **OpenAI GPT-3.5 API** to generate natural language responses. You will need an OpenAI API key, which you can get from [OpenAI's website](https://beta.openai.com/signup/).

The core API interaction happens in `index.py`:

```python
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=messages,
    max_tokens=200,
    temperature=0.4
)
```

- `model`: Specifies the AI model used (`gpt-3.5-turbo`).
- `messages`: Holds the chat history and system prompt for generating responses.
- `max_tokens`: Limits the length of the generated response.
- `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the response.
